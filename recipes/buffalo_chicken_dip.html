        <h1>Buffalo Chicken Dip</h1>
        <h2>It's my wife's recipe so I'd say it's the best out there.</h2>
        <p>Here's a list of what you'll need. Ingredients: </p> <ul>
            <li>Chicken</li>
            <li>Sour Cream</li>
            <li>Cream Cheese</li>
            <li>Frank's RedHot Buffalo Sauce</li>
            <li>Ranch Seasoning Packet</li>
            <li>Cheddar Cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The First thing you're going to want to do is find some good chicken. 
            My wife prefers rotisserie chicken because it's easy and tastes good but whatever you use will work.
        Next you want to shred your chicken and add to a slow cooker. You can cook this in the oven, if that tickles your fancy, at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 20 to 30 minutes or until it's all melded together just make sure to use an oven safe pan.
    It's pretty simple after that. All you do is throw everything together in the slow cooker (or pot/pan) and let it work it's magic.
Don't forget to save some cheese for the top!</p>
<p>You may have noticed that I left out any measurements for the ingredients and thats for a good reason.
    My wife firmly believes in "going until my ancestors tell me to stop."
    She couldn't tell you what measurements she uses but I'll tell you this.
    Cook with your heart and you won't go wrong. It's seriously hard to mess this recipe up. (Trust me I know)
    Don't be afraid to taste everything along the way and add what you need to.
    </p>

    <p>Happy Cooking!</p>
