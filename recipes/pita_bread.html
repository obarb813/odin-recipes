    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Check out this easy pita bread recipe that will have you regretting all the grocery store ones you've tasted.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup warm water (100 degrees F / 38 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 ¾ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer and add 1 cup warm water and 1 cup flour. Whisk together, then let sit until mixture bubbles and foams, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt into the yeast mixture, followed by 1 1/2 cups flour. Mix at low speed, using a dough hook attachment, until dough is soft, supple, and slightly sticky. Knead dough with machine on low speed until slightly springy and still soft, 5 to 6 minutes. If dough sticks to the sides of the bowl, add up to 1/4 cup more flour, a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a floured work surface and form into a ball.</li>
        <li>Wipe inside of bowl with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough around in bowl to lightly cover with oil; cover bowl with foil and let rise until dough has doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Once dough has doubled, remove from bowl and place onto a lightly floured work surface. Lightly pat into a flat shape about 1-inch thick. Use a knife to cut dough into 8 equal pieces.</li>
        <li>Form each piece into a small round ball with a smooth top, pulling dough from the sides and tucking the ends underneath the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cover dough balls with lightly oiled plastic wrap and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough balls to a lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the tops with flour. One at a time, gently pat the dough with your fingers, forming a flat, round disc about 1/4-inch thick. Let the shaped dough rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush a cast iron skillet with remaining 3/4 teaspoon olive oil and place over medium-high heat. Lay one round of dough into the hot skillet; cook for 30 seconds, then flip and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip again and cook the first side for 1 to 2 minutes more, until both sides are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stack cooked breads on a plate; when cool enough to handle, slice breads in half and open the pocket inside for stuffing.</li>
    </ol>
